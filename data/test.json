   "Answer":   "C.\tIron studies",
   "Description": [
    "A is incorrect because a blood transfusion isn’t indicated at this moment (Hb not low enough); more important to look for cause of issue",
    "B is incorrect because it is premature; we don’t have a diagnosis of iron deficiency yet and going straight to an invasive procedure such as an endoscopy is not warranted with just a low MCV and symptoms ",
    "C is the correct answer because iron studies will confirm the diagnosis and allow us to evaluate the patient further for a cause", 
    "D is incorrect because prescribing ferrous sulfate will not solve the problem, it will just mask the symptoms ",
    "E is incorrect because, even though it is a good idea, it is not the next best step; we have confirmed the cause of our patient’s issues yet. First we have to diagnose the patient, then look for the source of the problem, and then change the medications"
